Class Overview
==============

This class is intended to efficiently manage the results returned from an external source.

You configure an instance of this class optionally using a sectionKey. Also you can set filter, or some sorts for entities and sections. Then by calling the fetch method of the class and passing the entities you got from an external source, the instance starts to manipulate datas for you.
You can insert, remove, change, or reorder entities without worrying about managing them in the model.

This class is tailored to work in conjunction with views that present collections of objects. These views typically expect their data source to present results as a list of sections made up of rows. ModelAssistant can efficiently analyze the datas you passed to it and pre-compute all the information about sections of the objects. In addition:
* The assistant monitors changes to objects its fetched, and reports changes to its delegate.
* All the methods of assistant are completely thread safe. So you can use methods to change objects in assistant and add or remove them in any thread and even concurrently, and the assistant executes your tasks, in order and updates your views that are adapted assistant delegate respectively.

Typical use
===========

Developers create an instance of ModelAssistant and configure it. It is expected that the sectionKey used in the instance, groups the results into sections. This allows for section information to be pre-computed.
After creating an instance, the fetch(_:completion:) method should be called to perform the fetching.
Once started, convenience methods on the instance can be used for configuring the initial state of the view.

You can use this class to mange databases like Json, PropertyList, etc. Also you can configure this class methods to works with datamodels like coredata, realm, etc. A delegate can be set on the class so that it's also notified when the result objects have changed. This would typically be used to update the display of the view.
WARNING: The assistant only performs change tracking if a delegate is set and responds to any of the change tracking notification methods.  See the ModelAssistantDelegate protocol for which delegate methods are change tracking.

//MARK: - ModelAssistant
/**
An assistant that you use to manage the results of an external source and display data to the user.

While table views can be used in several ways, modelAssistant primarily assist you with a master list view. UITableView expects its data source to provide cells as an array of sections made up of rows. You configure a modelAssistant, optionally with a sectionKey, filter and sort orders. The modelAssistant efficiently analyzes the input objects that you pass in it by calling `fetch(_:completion:)` method and computes all the information about sections of these objects. It also computes all the information for the index based on the fetched objects.

In addition:
* The assistant monitors changes to objects its fetched, and reports changes to its delegate.

* All the methods of assistant are completely thread safe. So you can use methods to change objects in assistant and add or remove them in any thread even concurrently, and the assistant executes your tasks, in order and updates your views that are adapted assistant delegate respectively.

An assistant thus effectively has two modes of operation, determined by whether it has a delegate:

* No tracking: The delegate is set to nil. The assistant simply provides access to the data as it was when the fetch method was executed.


* Memory tracking: the delegate is non-nil. The assistant monitors objects and updates section and ordering information in response to relevant changes.

- Important:
The objects that passed in to the modelAssistant must be adapted **MAEntity & Hashable** protocols
